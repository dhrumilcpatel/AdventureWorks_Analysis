# AdventureWorks_Analysis

The AdventureWorks Dashboard project, developed using Power BI, showcases a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, a fictional cycling equipment company. This project demonstrates the ability to create insightful, accurate, and aesthetically pleasing reports. The dataset, provided by Maven Analytics, includes various features such as analyzing product-level trends, tracking KPIs related to revenue, sales, returns, and profit, comparing sales performance across regions, and identifying high-value customers. The dashboard incorporates advanced AI visuals like the decomposition tree and anomaly detection to enhance data insights. It includes multiple views: the Executive Summary View for high-level KPI tracking, the Map View for order distribution by location, the Product Detail View for detailed product performance analysis, and the Customer Detail View for overall and per-customer analysis.

Key insights from the dashboard reveal that AdventureWorks generated approximately $24.9 million in revenue and $10.5 million in profit between January 2020 and June 2022. Accessories, particularly tires and tubes, are the most ordered products, while bike sales contribute significantly to the total profit. Clothing has the highest return rate, with shorts being the most returned item, and an outlier in bike returns suggests a potential manufacturer defect. The United States accounts for the highest percentage of orders, followed by a surprisingly large market in Australia. Customer growth spiked significantly from January 2020 to July 2021, likely due to an event such as a new location opening, while revenue per customer has declined, potentially due to factors like inflation and post-Covid manufacturing costs. December sees the largest revenue spikes, likely due to the Christmas holiday season.
